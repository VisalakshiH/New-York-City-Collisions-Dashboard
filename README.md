<p>This is an interactive Traffic Safety Dashboard built completely using Excel â€” based on a real dataset from the NYC Traffic 
  Safety Maven Analytics guided project. </p>

<p>
This project helped me gained knowledge on :

<li>Cleaning and preparing real-world traffic data </li>
<li>Creating interactive visuals like heatmaps, bar charts & trend lines using MS Excel</li>
  </ul>
</p>

Below is a screenshot of the dashboard: <br>
